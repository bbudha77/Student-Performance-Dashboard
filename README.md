# Student Performance Dashboard ☑📊

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **student performance data** using **Power BI** for data transformation, visualization, and insight generation. The dataset includes student grades, enrollment trends, and payment methods across different regions.



## Data Cleaning & Transformation

- **Power Query** was used to:
  - Clean and transform raw data.
  - Remove duplicate values.
  - Ensure consistency in data types.

## Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes **five key insights** along with dynamic filters for better interactivity.

### 📊 Key Metrics (Top Visuals)

- **Total Student Count** – Displays the number of students analyzed.
- **Grade Distribution** – Highlights the percentage of students falling into different grade categories (A, B, C).
- **Slicers for Filtering Data**:
  - **Name-Based Filtering** – Allows selection of individual students.
  - **Country-Based Filtering** – Filters data based on student nationality.

### 1️⃣ Pie Chart: Student Breakdown by Grade

- Represents the proportion of students achieving different grades.
- Helps in understanding grade distribution across the student population.

### 2️⃣ Line Graph: Student Enrollment Trends

- Displays year-wise student enrollment patterns.
- Highlights peaks and drops in enrollment over time.
- Useful for identifying long-term trends and forecasting future student enrollments.

### 3️⃣ Student Distribution by Country & Field of Study

- **Table Visualization** shows the number of students in different academic disciplines (Arts, Commerce, Engineering, Science).
- Helps analyze student preference trends across various regions.

### 4️⃣ Bar Graph: Count of Student_ID by Payment Method

- Compares student payment preferences (Credit Card, Cash, Online Payment, Bank Transfer).
- Useful for financial planning and understanding student payment behavior.

### 5️⃣ Enrollment Table: Student Enrollment by Date

- Displays enrollment data over different time periods.
- Helps institutions track admission trends efficiently.

## Insights Gained

- Grade distribution analysis provides a clear picture of student academic performance.
- Enrollment trends help identify fluctuations and peak admission periods.
- Location-wise student analysis assists in decision-making for academic planning.
- Payment method insights enable better financial management for institutions.
